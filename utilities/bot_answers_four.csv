This is the current value of your car at the time of the claim and may be different from the amount you paid for the car or any amount you provided when you insured your car. However, it's important to note that the hire car company's terms and conditions also apply, and if there's any conflict between the hire car company's terms and the insurance policy, the insurance policy terms will apply."
"Based on the information provided, the main driver of the car insured under the DriveSure policy may be covered for liability to others when driving another car. This means that the main driver is covered if they cause an accident while driving another car, as long as they are not covered by another insurance policy.

The insurance policy states that they will not pay a claim for theft or attempted theft if the car is left unlocked, with keys or key fobs in, on, or attached to the car, with the engine running, or with a window or roof open. Additionally, you must take all reasonable steps to protect your car keys from loss or damage."

"In the context of car insurance, an ""excess"" refers to the amount that you may have to pay towards a claim.

For example, if you have a $500 excess and make a claim for $3000, your insurance would cover $2500 of the claim, and you would be responsible for paying the first $500. It's important to note that you may have different excesses for different types of claims or for different drivers on your policy.
